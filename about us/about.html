                    <p>The idea of RSGIFTS took shape in 2019 when it was identified that there is no online gift shop
                        that
                        satisfies the need of gift deliveries across our country.
                        Then, we started tying up with the local gift shops in different cities.
                        And now, we take pride to boast, our business and start our web page which people can access
                        easily
                        and enjoy our service.
                        Further, we take utmost pride in being able to provide real time shopping assistance round the
